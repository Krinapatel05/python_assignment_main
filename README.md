### 📄 Introduction
- This project is a solution to the task for course DLMDSPWP01 – Programming with Python. The objective is to process four training datasets and one test dataset, each containing x-y pairs of values, and map them to 50 ideal functions. The program selects four ideal functions that best fit the training data using the least-square criterion. The test data is then mapped to these chosen functions based on a specific deviation threshold.

### ✨ Features
- 🎯 Selects four ideal functions that best fit the training data.
- 🔗 Maps test data to the chosen ideal functions based on deviation criteria.
- 📊 Visualizes the training data, test data, ideal functions, and deviations.
- ✅ Incorporates unit tests to verify program functionality.
- 🏗 Utilizes object-oriented design with inheritance and exception handling.

### 🛠 Technologies Used
- Programming Language: Python 🐍
- Libraries/Tools:
- Pandas 📊
- NumPy 🔢
- SQLAlchemy 🗃
- Bokeh 📈
- SQLite 🗄

### ⚙️ Installation and Setup
1. Clone the repository:
<br> git clone https://github.com/Krinapatel05/python_assignment_main

2.	Navigate to the project directory:
<br>cd assignment-project

3.	Install the required Python libraries:<br>
<t> sqlalchemy
<br><t> pandas
<br><t> numpy
<br><t> scikit-learn
<br><t> bokeh



### 🚀 Usage
1.	Ensure the required datasets (training data, test data, and ideal functions) are available.
2.	Run the main program:
python main.py
3.	The program will load the datasets into an SQLite database, select the best fit ideal functions, map the test data, and visualize the results.
